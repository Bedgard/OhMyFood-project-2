## Project Introduction

Ohmyfood is a modern, responsive restaurant website designed with a mobile-first approach.  
The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly digital menu experience that works flawlessly on all devices — from smartphones to desktops.

Built entirely with semantic HTML5 and Sass (SCSS) for styling, this project avoids any JavaScript, demonstrating how CSS animations and interactions alone can create engaging, dynamic user interfaces.

This project highlights clean, maintainable code, smooth CSS animations, and a focus on accessibility and responsive design best practices.

## Features

### • Custom Loading Animation  
Elegant animated loader using pure CSS keyframes for initial feedback.

### • Interactive Menu Reveal  
Staggered fade-in of menu items using CSS transitions and delays for a smooth visual experience.

### • CSS-Based "Like" Button  
Heart-shaped toggle animation with no scripts required — purely CSS.

### • Fully Responsive Layout  
Mobile-first approach with fluid grid and layout adjustments for tablets and desktops.

### • No JavaScript  
Every interactive effect, from animations to toggles, is implemented using only HTML and CSS.
