## 🚀 Project Overview

Ohmyfood! is a handcrafted, pixel-perfect recreation of a restaurant website designed to deliver a seamless mobile-first experience.  
Built with **HTML5** and **Sass (SCSS)**, the project focuses on semantic markup, modular styles, and zero JavaScript.  
I implemented smooth CSS animations and dynamic menu reveal effects purely with CSS and HTML.

## 🎯 What I Built

- 🌀 **Custom Loader Animation**: Created a CSS keyframes spinner that provides visual feedback during page loads.  
- 🍽️ **Dynamic Menu Reveal**: Implemented menus that fade in with CSS transitions, enhancing user engagement without JS.  
- ❤️ **Pure CSS Like Button**: Designed an interactive heart-shaped toggle button that animates on click using only CSS.  
- 📱 **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Developed fully responsive layouts that adapt fluidly from small mobile screens to desktops using media queries and flexible units.  
- ⚡ **No JavaScript**: Achieved all interactive behaviors and animations with semantic HTML and CSS only, respecting project constraints.
